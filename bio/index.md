## Jenni Darkbloom

Rising from her castle's crypt--nestled in the coastal woods of Maine--Jenni Darkbloom is here to suck your tips, respectfully. Originally from Massachusetts, this transplanted transfemme's typical influences include: the shadows of smoky gothic-industrial dance clubs, the beauty of a garden springing to life, and cats of all sizes. She's a founder of the big sparkles gang, and has a love of all things ruffled. In 2023, Jenni plunged into the dark arts of the burlesque world by becoming an overly prepared kitten. Soon after, she added dancing to her repertoire—performing throughout Maine. She hopes you will be entranced by this ethereal world as much as she has been bewitched by this alluring adventure.
