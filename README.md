# About

Howdy! Thanks for stopping by! I'm Jenni Darkbloom, a burlesque dancer, teacher, and [kitten](https://kittening.darkbloom.dance). I started performing in 2023, and I'm based out of Maine.

I believe that we can _all_ win, and get super excited about collaboration.

- [Eye Candy Dance and Fitness](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100078283869662)
- [Mak the Knife](https://www.youtube.com/@mak_the_knife/featured)
