# Solo Acts

## Amelia Arsenic - Choke

This was my first ever solo, and easily my most refined. Jenni the Vampiress is looking for a victim, and hoo boy does she find one.

## Frankie Yankovic - Who Stole The Keeshka

I got a butcher shop to open where on Earth did my huge sausage go? Oh f--k oh s--t oh no no no where is it!?! Oh there it is. Nice.

## Tweaker - Worse Than Yesterday

A 2005 vintage mall-goth doing slow seductive propwork to a slow seductive tune.

## Blue Brew Music - Mii Channel

Jenni is running late (or had to leave early), but got her bestie, Sparkles Moonbeam (an 8 foot tall unicorn) to fill in for her. Chair acro!

## Mellowdrone - Orange Marmalade

KRAMPUS ACT! KRAMPUS ACT!
